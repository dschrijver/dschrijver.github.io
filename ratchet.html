        <p>The smallest scales are currently being reached for the fabrication of electronic devices. Another way of increasing the density of these devices can be to extend them into the third dimension. One of the devices that can already be made in a three-dimensional configuration is called a shift register. It transfers data along a chain, and it can be constructed out of transistors. However, this would drastically increase the complexity of the process flow required for the production of the device. Another way of constructing a shift register is by making use of magnetic kink solitons, which are vertically transferred throughout a stack of sub-nanometer thick layers of ferromagnetic material [1]. 
        </p>
        <p>We start with a stack of magnetic layers with an out-of-plane uniaxial anisotropy. These layers are antiferromagnetically coupled by an RKKY coupling. This means that all layers are alligned antiparallel in the ground state. We now introduce a frustration in the stack, where two spins are now alligned parallel. This frustration is called a magnetic kink soliton.

        </div>
        <p>By carefully tuning properties such as the thicknesses of the layers and the coupling strenghts, a scheme can be devised to move the soliton vertically throughout the stack. This is done by applying an external magnetic field.

        <p>The specifics behind the ratchet mechanism can be worked out analytically by making use of the Ising model [1]. This model assumes that each layer has a single-domain macrospin magnetization, and that the magnetization always points along the easy axis. The switching field of each layer can be computed analytically, and the Ising model assumes that a layer switches when an external field is applied that is larger than the switching field. This simple model gives a good estimation for what kind of fields are needed to switch layers during the ratchet operation. Requirements can be derived which the ratchet paramaters have to fulfill in order for the device to function. However, the Ising model is missing time dependence. This means that it can't give predictions about the speed and stability of the ratchet. 
        </p>
        <p>The analysis of the soliton ratchet done in previous work [1] can be expanded by making use of a different model for the evolution of the magnetizations of ferromagnetic materials, which is the LLG equation. This model does take into account the time evolution of each magnetization in each layer of the stack, but it still assumes macrospins. The LLG equation is given by:
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{d \vec{M}}{dt} = \gamma \mu_0 \left(\vec{M} \times \vec{H}_{\text{eff}}\right) + \frac{\alpha}{M_s}\left(\vec{M} \times \frac{d\vec{M}}{dt}\right)
        \end{equation}
        Where $\gamma = \frac{-|e|}{2m_e}\left|g_e\right| \approx -1.7609\cdot10^{11}\frac{\text{rad}}{\text{T s}}$  is the gyromagnetic ratio, with $g_e \approx -2$ as the electron g-factor. The vaccuum permeability is given by $\mu_0 \approx 1.2566 \cdot 10^{-6}\frac{\text{T m}}{\text{A}}$. The first term is the torque on the magnetization by the total magnetic field $\vec{H}_{\text{eff}}$, and the second term is the introduced damping, scaled by the Gilbert damping $\alpha$. Finally, the saturation magnetization of the material is given by $M_s$. The magnetization and the effective magnetic field are both given in units of A/m. This equation can be rewritten in an explicit form for small $\alpha$:
        \begin{equation}
            \frac{d \vec{M}_n}{dt} = \frac{\gamma \mu_0}{1 + \alpha^2}\left(\left(\vec{M}_n \times \vec{H}_{n}^{\text{eff}}\right) + \frac{\alpha}{M_s} \left[\vec{M}_n \times \left(\vec{M}_n \times \vec{H}_{n}^{\text{eff}}\right)\right]\right)
        \end{equation}
        Where an index n is already introduced for the layer number. This system of equations can be solved using iterative methods such as Runge-Kutta.

        </div>
        <p>The only thing left before this equation can be solved is to find the effective magnetic field $\vec{H}_{\text{eff}}$ on each layer, which is simply the sum of all magnetic fields acting on the layer. The first contribution comes from the externally applied magnetic field $\vec{H}_{\text{ext}}(t)$. The second field is the demagnetizing field, given by $\vec{H}_{D} = -\mathbf{N} \vec{M}_n$, where we assume the ferromagnetic layer to be infinitely thin: $\mathbf{N} = \text{diag}(0, 0, 1)$. The next term in the effective field comes from the uniaxial anisotropy along the z-axis, given by $\vec{H}_A = \frac{2 K^{\text{eff}}_n}{\mu_0 M_s^2}\left(\vec{M}_n \cdot \hat{z}\right)\hat{z}$. The effective anisotropy term used here is given by: $K^{\text{eff}}_n = K_v + \frac{K_s}{t_n}$, where $K_v$ and $K_s$ are the volume and surface anisotropy, respectively. The units of the anisotropy constant are given by $[K^{\text{eff}}_n] = \frac{J}{m^3}$.
        Furthermore, $t_n$ is the thickness of the layer along the z-axis.

        </div>
        <p>Finally, we have the magnetic field acting on the layer due to the exchange couplings with the layers on top and on the bottom, called the RKKY interaction [3]. This field is given by:
        \begin{equation}
            \vec{H}_{\text{ex}} = \frac{J_{n-1,n}}{\mu_0 M_s^2 t_n} \vec{M}_{n-1} + \frac{J_{n,n+1}}{\mu_0 M_s^2 t_n} \vec{M}_{n+1}
        \end{equation}
        Where the units of the coupling strength are given by $[J] = \frac{J}{m^2}$. This gives the final equation for the effective magnetic field acting on layer n in the soliton ratchet:
        \begin{equation}
            \vec{H}_{n}^{\text{eff}} =\vec{H}_{\text{ext}}(t) - \mathbf{N} \vec{M}_n + \frac{2 K^{\text{eff}}_n}{\mu_0 M_s^2} \left(\vec{M}_n \cdot \hat{z}\right)\hat{z} + \frac{J_{n-1,n}}{\mu_0 M_s^2 t_n} \vec{M}_{n-1} + \frac{J_{n,n+1}}{\mu_0 M_s^2 t_n} \vec{M}_{n+1}
        \end{equation}
